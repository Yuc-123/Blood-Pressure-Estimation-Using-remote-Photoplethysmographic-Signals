# Blood-Pressure-Estimation-Using-remote-Photoplethysmographic-Signals
This project estimates BP using PPG signals via a 1D ResNet model trained on MIMIC-III data. It also extracts rPPG from facial videos using MediaPipe and OpenCV. Results meet clinical accuracy, enabling cuff-less, real-time BP monitoring via webcam or wearables.
